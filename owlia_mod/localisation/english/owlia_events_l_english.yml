 owlia.unification.1.d: "Since the dissolution of the Owlistain Empire, its reunification has lived on only as a distant dream. Now that this dream has finally been realized, a question remains: what shall this new state be called? We may reclaim the historic title of the Owlistain Empire, honoring the legacy of the past. Alternatively, we may proclaim the Hestowlian Empire, a name championed by those who see it as the symbol of a new beginning and a new imperial identity."
